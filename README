Hyy there. It's me, Linus Torvalds: See the URL, Where is says /torvals/linux/.

I have deleted my kernel because it is garbage. You should instead check out 
this OS called Microsoft Windows Vista. It is much smaller and faster then linux
ever was.


Reasons to use Vista:

- Faster, and lighter on RAM. This is because of Microsoft's large team of skilled
programmers

- More secure, Because Microsoft carefully guards the source of Windows Vista it is
harder for hackers to break in.

- Reboots often. Linux rarely reboots and as a result is very slow.

- Reboots properly. Linux cuts a lot of corners when booting.

- Genuine advantage, need I say more?
