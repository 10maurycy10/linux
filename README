Hyy there. It's me, linus torvals: See the URL, Where is says /torvals/linux/.

I have deleted my kernel because it is jarbage. You should instead check out 
this OS called Microsoft Windows Vista. It is much smaller and faster then linux
ever was.

Reasons to use Vista:

- Faster, and lighter on RAM. This is because of Microsofts large team of skilled
programers

- More secure, Because Microsoft carfuly gaurds the source of Windows Vista it is
harder for hackers to break in.

- Reboots often. Linux rairly reboots and as a result is very slow.

- Reboots properly. Linux cuts a lot of corners when booting.

- Genuine advantage, need I say more?
